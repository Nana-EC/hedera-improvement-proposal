## Abstract

On many EVM chains execution costs are fully captured in gas. Thus submitting transactions to execution nodes bears no
cost to the relay node. On Hedera it is necessary to charge a fee for `EthereumTransaction` HAPI submissions (just like
all other HAPI transactions).

This HIP suggests the network logic not charge successful `EthereumTransaction` submissions, but instead only charge the
regular HAPI fee for badly formed transactions.

## Motivation

Relay operators must pay the `EthereumTransaction` HAPI fee for every transaction they submit on behalf of an EOA.
Currently for every `EthereumTransaction` this is the hbar equivalent of $0.0001 based on the exchange rate.
Though very cheap, this additional HAPI fee charge effectively forces relay operators on Hedera to adopt a business
model that is more expensive for them than operating on other EVM chains. These costs often get passed onto users
which inhibits EOA access to low gas fees on Hedera.

This serves as a friction point to EOAs in accessing cheap relay operators on the network.

## Rationale

`EthereumTransaction` HAPI logic charges inner transaction EOAs gas for the transaction execution work.
As such on every transaction `tx.from` is debited an hbar fee to cover the `gas * gasPrice`.
This ensures the network does effectively charges for work.
Thus there is a clear pathway fpr the network to charge a user based on usage making it unnecessary to charge the
relay operator. However, to encourage relayers to perform prechecks transactions that fail will follow the regular
HAPI logic and still incur a submission fee.

## User stories

1. As a relay operator I want to submit an `EthereumTransaction` on behalf of an EOA and pay 0 in cryptocurrency costs
like I do on other EVM chains.
2. As a relay operator I will pay the HAPI transaction fee for `EthereumTransaction` submissions that fail.
  
## Specification

The consensus node HAPI charging logic for `EthereumTransaction` submissions should be updated to the following
- If the `EthereumTransaction` succeeds do not charge the AccountId submitter
- If the `EthereumTransaction` fails do charge the AccountId submitter

In both cases the `tx.from` EOA address should be charged the appropriate gas.

## Backwards Compatibility

No changes to transaction execution or record stream externalization is made in this HIP.
`EthereumTransaction` will continue to work and will only see a reduction in cost on success cases.

## Security Implications

The network maintains a 21k minimum gas expense to the EOA and the equivalent HBAR will be deducted to cover costs.
Beyond this the EVM and Hedera security model remain in effect.
